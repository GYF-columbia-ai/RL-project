# Prompt-Conditioned Active Object Detection with Dueling DQN
This project is aimed to reformulate active object detection as a reinforcement-learning problem and inject rich, prompt-driven semantics via modern vision–language backbones. We first benchmark ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, and BLIP-2 features inside an identical DQN agent to show that stronger representations alone boost AP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007 from 3.9 % to over 94 %. We then introduce a lightweight cross-attention fusion DQN that aligns InstructBLIP prompt embeddings with ViT image tokens and add a dueling head—training only this fusion module while keeping all large models frozen. Under a 15-step budget, our method achieves 100 % AP and Recall across IoU thresholds 0.1–0.5 on the VOC2007 person class, effectively closing the longstanding precision gap
